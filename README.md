# Gender-Classification

Below is the file structure used for this project.

```bash
├── Main Data Directory
│   ├── images folder
│   ├── output.csv
│   ├── train.csv
│   ├── test.csv
│   ├── weights file(.h5 format)
```
I have not added the images folder and weights file, due to file size constraints. The image data can be downloaded from the contest home page: https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/gender-classification/, and weights can be saved by merely running the model.save(), in the ipynb notebook.
